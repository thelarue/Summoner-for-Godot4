Dear Simon,

We know that you have been suffering with insomnia, but please don’t mix up sleeping powder with Alchemic Fire. I understand that both are made from black herb but the difference is that former uses red herb and the latter is used with White Phosphorus. If you can, can you please just tough it out for a few more days, we need the black herb for more summons. 

We also don’t want to spend more resources on making a healing potion to heal you after you get inevitably burned. Just wasting more of our red herb and wild berries that we are already running out of. Please keep that in mind.

Kind regards, Weston
